# Stroke-Prediction-with-ML-Model
Supervised machine learning model for stroke prediction (Kaggle Dataset) using Scikit-learn
In this project I used a stroke predicition dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/code/brunovr/strokeprediction-mindtherecall/data). I did some data exploration and data cleaning. Then I evaluated different models for the dataset using cross validation. I chose SGD and did hyperparameter tunning to optimize the model's performance. Finally, I constructed a confusion matrix highlighting the test results and created a little demo at the end.
